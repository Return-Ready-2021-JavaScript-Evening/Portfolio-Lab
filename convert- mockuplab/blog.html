You're probably wondering... "why did you decide to start skydiving?" Well I loved the thrill. I loved that in those 60 seconds of free fall I was right there in that moment. Its so rerfrshing exciting. Especially when you are doing it with friends.     </p>

            <p class="card-text"> In July A friend and I drove up to northern PA and rented a campsite. Soon as we arrive we set up camp, put our tent together and got the fire started.  It had been abnoput 10 years since I had actually slept in the tent. Im not goung to lie i was a bit nervous about wild life. But I think because it was a heavily populated camping area alot of the animals kept away. We didnt cook any food over the fire b/c we were only statying for one night and we brought sandwhiches to keep it a bit simple. Overall This trip was one of the highlights of my 2020. </p>
